            During the Summer of 2025 I was able to work as a Vivint Technician all throughout the State 
            of Alaska. I worked in Anchorage, Wasilla, Kenai, Soldotna, and Fairbanks. Work was always 
            busy, yet we always found time to enjoy the nature around us. The midnight sun made it 
            possible to do things outside even when we usually got off work around 10:00. 
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            We did a lot of fishing, hiking, and driving. A wise man once said, 
            <em>"Never go to Alaska as a young man, because you'll never be satisfied with any other 
            place as long as you live."</em> Although I love it here, it is true that Alaska is a 
            magical place like nothing else I've ever seen.

            I had been wanting to hike Mount Timpanogos for the past year. Every time I decided I was going 
            to do it, something showed up in my schedule and I pushed the hike off for another time. This 
            school year was the same deal. Every weekend I had something going on and couldn’t find the time 
            to make the hike.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            It was getting later and later in the season and it seemed like I might have to wait another year. 
            I read a couple of blog posts about hiking late in the season and according to most people, it 
            wasn’t too dangerous. I gathered my gear, made a plan, and set out for the hike.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            The hike was definitely more difficult because of all the snow and a bit more risky. I slowly worked 
            my way up the mountain and eventually reached the top after a couple of nasty scrambles. The views 
            were awesome, and I made it home safe.

            I served as a missionary in Finland for 2 years. It was definitely the most important 2 years of my 
            life. The country of Finland is amazing and so are the people. The people are quiet and reserved, 
            but once you get to know them, they are really sweet.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            They speak a difficult language that took a lot of time and effort to understand and speak. Finland 
            is covered in forests and lakes, and it is truly a beautiful country filled with incredible people.
